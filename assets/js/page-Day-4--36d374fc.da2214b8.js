The other issue we had was occasionally we would argue about how to do something instead just writing it out and trying it. This wasted some time. We learned part way through that it's better to actually try it and see if it works than to argue that it won't. Overall though, i think we worked pretty well as a team.")])])}),[],!1,null,null,null);t.default=r.exports}}]);
